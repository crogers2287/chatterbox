```

This will start the Gradio interface at http://localhost:7860

   - Add multiple voice profiles
   - Try the batch upload with multiple files

## Development Notes

- Authentication is bypassed with `VITE_BYPASS_AUTH=true`
- User data is stored per user ID in localStorage
- The audiobook API endpoints expect port 7860
- All features work with mock data if backend isn't running

## Troubleshooting

1. **Check services**: `python3 test_setup.py`
2. **Restart frontend**: `cd chatterbox-webui && npm run dev`
3. **Check browser console**: F12 ‚Üí Console tab
4. **Clear browser cache**: Ctrl+Shift+R

## Next Steps

1. Explore the audiobook interface
2. Upload some text/markdown files
