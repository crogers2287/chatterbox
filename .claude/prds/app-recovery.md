# PRD: app-recovery

## Executive Summary

The app-recovery feature provides robust recovery mechanisms for the Chatterbox TTS application, ensuring users never lose their work due to crashes, network interruptions, or browser issues. This includes automatic session recovery, audio file recovery, and graceful handling of service failures with minimal user disruption.

## Problem Statement

Users currently face data loss and frustration when:
- Browser crashes or tabs close unexpectedly during TTS generation
- Network connectivity issues interrupt streaming audio sessions
- Backend service failures result in lost audiobook projects or voice configurations
- LocalStorage corruption causes loss of saved sessions and preferences

This is critical now because:
- Users are processing longer texts and audiobooks (hours of content)
- Voice cloning involves time-consuming setup that shouldn't be repeated
- Production usage requires reliability for content creators

## User Stories

### Persona 1: Content Creator (Primary)
**Journey**: Creating audiobook with 20 chapters
- Uploads custom voice reference
- Configures TTS parameters
- Starts batch processing
- Browser crashes at chapter 15
- **Pain Point**: Must restart entire process, losing 2 hours of work

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- On reopening app, sees "Recovery Available" prompt
- Can resume from chapter 16 with same voice/settings
- Previously generated chapters remain accessible

### Persona 2: Podcast Producer
**Journey**: Fine-tuning voice for episode intro
- Adjusts multiple parameters iteratively
- Generates 10+ test versions
- Network disconnects during generation
- **Pain Point**: Loses all test versions and parameter combinations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Automatic reconnection when network returns
- All generated audio versions preserved
- Parameter history available for comparison

### Persona 3: Accessibility User
**Journey**: Converting documents to audio daily
- Has specific voice preferences saved
- Browser storage gets corrupted
- **Pain Point**: Must reconfigure all preferences and voices

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Server-side backup of user preferences
- One-click preference restoration
- Automatic corruption detection and repair

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Session Recovery**
- Auto-save session state every 30 seconds
- Persist current text, parameters, and voice selection
- Recovery detection on app load
- One-click session restoration

**Audio Recovery**
- Server-side temporary audio storage (24 hours)
- Unique recovery tokens for each generation
- Batch recovery for audiobook projects
- Download recovery for interrupted transfers

**State Synchronization**
- Real-time sync between frontend and backend
- Conflict resolution for concurrent sessions
- Cross-device session recovery (future)

**Error Handling**
- Graceful degradation during service failures
- Queue persistence for pending requests
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- User notification of recovery actions

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- Recovery detection < 100ms on app load
- Session save overhead < 50ms
- No impact on TTS generation speed

**Security**
- Recovery tokens with 24-hour expiration
- User-scoped recovery data only
- Encrypted storage of sensitive parameters

**Scalability**
- Support 10,000 concurrent recovery sessions
- 1TB recovery storage capacity
- Automatic cleanup of expired data

**Reliability**
- 99.9% recovery success rate
- Recovery data replicated across availability zones
- Fallback to local recovery if server unavailable

## Success Criteria

**Quantitative Metrics**
- 95% reduction in reported data loss incidents
- < 2% of users need manual recovery assistance
- Average recovery time < 5 seconds
- Zero critical data loss events per month

**Qualitative Outcomes**
- User confidence in long-running operations
- Positive feedback on reliability
- Reduced support tickets for lost work

**Key Performance Indicators**
- Recovery success rate
- Time to recovery (TTR)
- User adoption of recovery features
- Support ticket reduction

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- Limited server storage (must expire data after 24 hours)
- Browser storage limitations (50MB localStorage)
- GDPR compliance for data retention
- No modification to core TTS models

### Assumptions
- Users have stable storage for recovery tokens
- Network interruptions are temporary (< 1 hour)
- Users want automatic recovery (opt-out available)
- Modern browser support (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)

## Out of Scope

- Long-term storage (> 24 hours)
- Cross-user session sharing
- Recovery of deleted voices
- Versioning of generated audio
- Mobile app recovery (different implementation)
- Real-time collaboration features

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Browser LocalStorage API availability
- IndexedDB for large data storage
- Server-sent events for recovery status

### Internal Dependencies
- API server stability for recovery endpoints
- Database capacity for recovery data
- Load balancer session affinity

### Technical Prerequisites
- Implement unique session identifiers
- Add recovery tables to database
- Create recovery API endpoints
- Extend frontend state management
