# Pause Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Chatterbox TTS Audiobook Edition now includes automatic pause insertion based on line breaks (returns) in your text input. For every line break (`\n` or `\r\n`) detected in your text, the system will automatically add a 0.1-second pause to the generated audio.

## How It Works

### Return-Based Pause System

- **Detection**: The system counts all line breaks in your input text
- **Duration**: Each line break adds exactly 0.1 seconds of silence
- **Accumulation**: Multiple line breaks accumulate (10 returns = 1 second pause)
- **Debug Output**: Terminal shows pause information when audio is generated

### Example

**Input Text:**
```
Hello, this is the first line.
This is the second line.

This line comes after an empty line.
Final line.
```

**Result:** 
- 4 line breaks detected
- 0.4 seconds of total pause time added
- Debug output: `ðŸ”‡ Detected 4 line breaks â†’ 0.4s total pause time`

## Features Supported

### âœ… Speech-to-Text Generation
- Single text input with returns
- Pauses added to the end of generated speech
- Debug output in terminal

### âœ… Single-Voice Audiobook Creation
- Text processing before chunking
- Pauses distributed throughout the audiobook
- Project metadata includes pause information

### âœ… Multi-Voice Audiobook Creation
- Character dialogue with natural pauses
- Pause processing applied before voice assignment
- Debug output shows total pause time added

### âœ… Batch Audiobook Processing
- Automatic pause processing for all files in batch
- Individual pause calculations per file

## Technical Implementation

### Text Processing Pipeline

1. **Input Text Analysis**
   ```python
   processed_text, return_count, total_pause_duration = process_text_for_pauses(text, 0.1)
   ```

2. **Silence Generation**
   ```python
   pause_audio = create_silence_audio(total_pause_duration, sample_rate)
   ```

3. **Audio Combination**
   ```python
   final_audio = np.concatenate([speech_audio, pause_audio])
   ```

### Debug Output Examples

**Speech-to-Text:**
```
ðŸ”‡ Detected 3 line breaks â†’ 0.3s total pause time
ðŸ”‡ Added 0.3s pause to speech (3 returns)
```

**Audiobook Creation:**
```
ðŸ”‡ Detected 15 line breaks â†’ 1.5s total pause time
ðŸ”‡ Adding 1.5s pause (15 returns Ã— 0.1s each)
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices

1. **Natural Breaks**: Use line breaks where you want natural pauses in speech
2. **Paragraph Separation**: Double line breaks create longer pauses
3. **Dialogue**: Separate character lines for better multi-voice audiobooks
4. **Punctuation**: Combine with punctuation for maximum effect

### Example Text Formatting

**Good for Natural Speech:**
```
Welcome to our story.
Let me tell you about a magical place.

In this place, anything is possible.
The adventure begins now.
```

**Good for Multi-Voice Audiobooks:**
```
[Narrator] The sun was setting over the hills.

[Character1] "We need to find shelter soon."

[Character2] "I see a cave up ahead.
Let's hurry before it gets dark."

[Narrator] They rushed toward the cave.
```

## Configuration

### Pause Duration
- **Current Setting**: 0.1 seconds per return
- **Location**: Hardcoded in processing functions
- **Customization**: Can be modified in `src/audiobook/processing.py`

### Sample Rate
- **Default**: 24,000 Hz
- **Compatibility**: Automatically matches model output
- **Quality**: High enough for natural-sounding pauses

## Testing

### Test Script
Run the included test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_pause_functionality.py
```

### Manual Testing
1. Create text with line breaks
2. Generate speech or audiobook
3. Check terminal for debug output
4. Listen for pauses in generated audio

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Pauses Heard:**
- Check if text actually contains line breaks (`\n`)
- Verify debug output appears in terminal
- Ensure audio player supports the full generated file

**Pauses Too Long/Short:**
- Current setting is 0.1s per return (not configurable via UI)
- Multiple consecutive returns will create longer pauses
- This is intended behavior for paragraph breaks

**Debug Output Missing:**
- Check terminal/console where the application is running
- Ensure you're using the updated functions
- Verify pause processing is enabled

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- User-configurable pause duration
- Different pause types (comma, period, paragraph)
- Visual indicators in the UI
- Pause preview before generation
- Advanced pause distribution algorithms

### Integration Ideas
- Export settings in voice profiles
- Project-level pause configuration
- Advanced text markup for pause control
- Audio timeline with pause indicators

**Note**: This feature is automatically enabled and requires no configuration. Simply use line breaks in your text where you want pauses, and the system will handle the rest!
