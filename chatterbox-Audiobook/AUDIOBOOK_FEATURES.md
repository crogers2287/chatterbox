## 🎯 Audiobook Workflow

### Step 1: Character Planning
- List all characters in your audiobook
- Gather reference audio for each (record or find samples)
- Plan voice characteristics (age, personality, accent)

### Step 2: Voice Creation
- Create a voice profile for each character
- Test and refine settings for consistency
- Save with descriptive names (e.g., "Harry_confident", "Hermione_intelligent")

### Step 3: Production
- Load character voice before generating their dialogue
- Use consistent settings throughout the book
- Test voice regularly to maintain quality

### Step 4: Quality Control
- Use the same test phrase for all characters
- Ensure voices are distinguishable
- Adjust settings if characters sound too similar

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Voice Creation
- **Reference Audio**: Use clean, noise-free recordings
- **Length**: 10-30 seconds is optimal

- **Temperature**:
  - 0.5-0.8: Consistent delivery
  - 0.8-1.2: More natural variation

### Organization
